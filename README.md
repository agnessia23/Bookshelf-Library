# Bookshelf-Library
This is a website called "Bookshelf Apps". On this website, we can add book data such as book title and author name. The website also provides two bookshelves, namely "Not Finished Reading" and "Finished Reading". Users are able to delete book data as well. The book data is stored using local storage.
